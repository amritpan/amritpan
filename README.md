### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an implementation-oriented engineer who enjoys working on programming language design and compilers. I have written several Swift Language Evolution proposals. Below is a running list:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/pull/2675"> Method & Initializer Keypaths</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0438-metatype-keypath.md"> Metatype Keypaths</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-allow-accessor-macros-on-let-declarations/66684"> Allow Accessor Macros on Let Declarations</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-allow-property-wrappers-on-let-declarations/61750"> Allow Property Wrappers on Let Declarations</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-refining-property-wrapper-related-initialization/52049"> Refining Property-Wrapper-Related Initialization</a></li>
</ul>

I have also worked on Swiftâ€™s type inference algorithm in the Swift compiler and have written about that work below:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-debug-output-of-the-type-inference-algorithm-an-update/60521"> Improving the Debug Output of the Type Inference Algorithm</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/key-path-inference-and-diagnostic-improvements-an-update/69632"> Key Path Inference and Diagnostic Improvements</a></li> 
</ul>

Previously, I worked as an iOS engineer after undergrad at UC Berkeley and grad at Georgia Tech where I focused on improving LLVM's debug info.
